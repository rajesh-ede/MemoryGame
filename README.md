## 🧠 Memory Game - Java Console Application

This project is a **simple console-based Memory Game** built in Java to demonstrate basic programming concepts such as arrays, lists, loops, user input handling, conditionals, and randomness. The game simulates a classic memory matching game where a player must find matching pairs of cards hidden on a board.


### 📌 Features

* 4 pairs of cards (total 8 cards) labeled `A`, `B`, `C`, and `D`
* Cards are shuffled randomly at the start of each game
* Players flip two cards per turn by entering their indices
* If the flipped cards match, they stay revealed; otherwise, they are flipped back
* Tracks the number of successfully found pairs
* Game ends when all pairs are found


 🎮 How to Play

1. The board starts with all cards face down (`" "`).
2. The user is prompted to select two different card indices to flip.
3. The selected cards are revealed on the board.
4. If the cards match, the pair stays visible.
5. If the cards don’t match, they are flipped back.
6. The process repeats until all 4 pairs are matched.



 🧑‍💻 Concepts Covered

* `ArrayList` and `Collections.shuffle()` for handling cards and randomness
* `Arrays.fill()` and boolean arrays for board state tracking
* Input validation using loops and conditionals
* Modular design with helper functions like printBoard() and getCardIndex()
* Core programming logic for memory/matching games

---

📦 Requirements

* Java 8 or above
* Command-line interface or IDE like IntelliJ, Eclipse, or VS Code

✅ How to Run

1. Clone the repository or copy the code into a `.java` file (e.g., `Geeks.java`)
2. Compile and run the file using:

bash
javac Geeks.java
java Geeks


3. Follow the on-screen instructions to play the game.


📚 Learning Outcome

This project is perfect for beginners who want to practice Java basics while building a fun and interactive mini-game. It demonstrates logic building, user interaction, and control flow in a clean and readable way.

📝 This sample run highlights input validation and game flow logic, providing a clear understanding of the user experience in the console.
